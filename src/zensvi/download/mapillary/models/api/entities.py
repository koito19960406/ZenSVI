class EntityAdapter(object):
    """Adapter model for dealing with the Entity API, through the DRY principle. The
    EntityAdapter class can be instantiated in the controller modules, providing an
    abstraction layer that uses the Client class, endpoints provided by the API v4 under
    `/config/api/entities.py`.

    It performs parsing, handling of layers, properties, and fields to make it easier to
    write higher level logic for extracing information, and lets developers to focus only
    on writing the high level business logic without having to repeat the process of parsing
    and using libraries such as `mercantile`, `ast`, and others to only then care about the
    inputs and the outputs

    Usage::

        >>> import mapillary
        >>> from mapillary.models.api.entities import EntityAdapter
        >>> EntityAdapter().fetch_image(image_id='IMAGE_ID', fields=[
        ...     'altitude', 'atomic_scale', 'geometry', 'width'
        ... ])
        >>> EntityAdapter().fetch_map_feature(map_feature_id='MAP_FEATURE_ID', fields=[
        ...         'first_seen_at', 'last_seen_at', 'geometry'
        ...     ])
