# SOME NOTES FROM THE API

Over Authentication
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. All requests against https://graph.mapillary.com must be authorized. They require a client or
    user access tokens. Tokens can be sent in two ways,

    1. Using ?access_token=XXX query parameters. This is a preferred method for interacting with an
        vector tiles. Using this method is STRONGLY discouraged for sending user access tokens
    2. Using a header such as Authorization: OAuth XXX, where XXX is the token obtained either
        through the OAuth flow that your application implements or a client token from
        https://mapillary.com/dashboard/developers
